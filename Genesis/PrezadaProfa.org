** TODO Scala script to generate the commands we enter


```scala 
import ammonite.ops._
import ammonite.ops.ImplicitWd._


```
** Change the keyboard layout

```sh
settings > keyboard > input layout > US Keyboard
```

** Setup the keyboard to US-English

** Since `java` is already installed we can direclty move to install `scala ammonite` shell for creating a pipeline

** Install the Ammonite repl

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/amm https://git.io/vdNv2 && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm && amm

#+END_SRC
